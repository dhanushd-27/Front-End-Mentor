### What I learned

+ I got to know about CSS Grid which is much reliable than other CSS properties.
+ About CSS Hover, We can change the properties of an element when the cursor is placed above it using CSS Hover Example <tag-name>hover:{ background-color: blue }
+ You we can use Linear Gradient Property in CSS to use multiple colours on the same     element. It super fun and Easy to learn, for example: If you Hover the Continue button you can observe we have used to colors on it.


### Continued development

+ to implement js on it and make it responsive and change values
+ to make the code much clean.

### Useful resources
