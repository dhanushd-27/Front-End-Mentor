## My process

The Card Components such as pattern card image are provided in the Initial Folder that you download from Front-End-Mentor

STEP-1
-Required Data such as Name,Age,Place is provided. You just have to write in a proper markup language
-After Writing a proper HTML code i.e by adding all the elements and background elements required as per design image provided

STEP-2
-With help of style-guide.md You can make your project somewhat similar to the the required output website.
-Import font from the provided link of weight 400 and 700.
-Use CSS Positioning Property to corner both the bg-pattern.
-Use flexbox to center all the elements.
-We can use box-shadow property to the card such that it has a pop-up view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

-Importing Google Fonts
-CSS Grid
-Flexbox
-Using Overflow: That makes the website non-scrollable
-Flexbox

### Continued development

Responsive and using Media Queries to make a Mobile Interface of the same.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Overflow](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_overflow.asp) - This helped me for solving Scroll issue which I really didn't want in this project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Box Shadow to cover all sides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnwlf18jUyI) - This is an amazing 1 minute video which helped me finally understand Box Shadow. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
